# Project Structure & Guidelines

This document outlines a recommended project directory structure and provides guidelines for organizing your code and assets, now with GitHub integration. Use this as a reference when setting up a new project based on the workflow guidelines.

## Recommended Directory Layout

A typical project might follow a structure similar to the one below:

```
project-root/
├── .github/                  # GitHub templates and configurations
│   ├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md  # PR template for consistent code reviews
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/       # Templates for creating GitHub issues
│       └── task.md           # Template for task issues
├── config/                  # Configuration files (e.g., config.json, config_schema.json)
├── docs/                    # Documentation
│   ├── ai_task_guide.md     # AI task guide
│   ├── ai_assistance_guide.md  # AI assistance guide
│   ├── work_tracking.md     # Work tracking document
│   └── tasks/               # Task-specific documents (e.g., TASK-123.md)
├── logs/                    # Log files generated by scripts
├── scripts/                 # Utility scripts for tasks and GitHub integration
│   ├── start_task.py        # Script to create GitHub issues and local task files
│   ├── finish_task.py       # Script to close GitHub issues and update task files
│   ├── task_logger.py       # Logging utilities
│   ├── config.ini           # GitHub repository configuration
│   └── .env                 # Environment file for GitHub token (not committed to repo)
├── src/                     # Source code for the application
│   ├── core/                # Core functionalities and business logic
│   ├── utils/               # Utility functions and helper modules
│   └── ...                  # Other modules and components
├── tests/                   # Test suite (unit tests, integration tests, etc.)
├── .gitignore               # Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
└── README.md                # Project overview and setup instructions
```

## Guidelines

- **GitHub Integration:**  
  Use the `.github` directory to store templates for pull requests and issues. These templates help standardize your workflow and improve collaboration.

- **Configuration:**  
  Place all configuration files in the `config/` directory. Ensure that sensitive data such as API tokens are stored in environment variables or `.env` files (which should be added to `.gitignore`).

- **Documentation:**  
  Maintain up-to-date documentation in the `docs/` folder. Task documentation is automatically generated in `docs/tasks/` when using the task scripts.

- **Scripts:**  
  The `scripts/` directory contains tools for task management with GitHub integration. Configure `config.ini` with your repository details and create a `.env` file with your GitHub token.

- **Logging:**  
  Script logs are stored in the `logs/` directory. These logs provide detailed information for troubleshooting and auditing tasks.

- **Source Code Organization:**  
  Organize your source code into meaningful modules in the `src/` directory. Separate core functionality, utilities, and specific features into dedicated subdirectories.

- **Testing:**  
  Keep your tests organized within the `tests/` directory. Aim for high test coverage to ensure the reliability of your application.

This structure can be adjusted based on project-specific needs but provides a strong foundation to maintain consistency and quality across projects with GitHub integration.
