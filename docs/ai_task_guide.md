# AI Task Guide

This guide serves as a central hub for AI assistants to understand the project's structure, processes, and conventions.

## Overview

- **Project Structure:** Review the recommended project structure in [project_structure.md](project_structure.md).
- **Work Tracking:** Refer to [work_tracking.md](work_tracking.md) to monitor task statuses.
- **Task Templates:** Use the task template provided in the `tasks` folder for documenting new tasks.

## Instructions

1. Before starting a task, review the current work tracking and guidelines.
2. Initiate a new task using the `scripts/start_task.py` script.
3. Document the task details by copying the `TASK_TEMPLATE.md` in the `docs/tasks/` folder and renaming it accordingly (e.g., WORKITEM-XXX.md).
4. Upon task completion, use the `scripts/finish_task.py` script to finalize the task status.
